      These ski goggles were a personal project I completed
      during my spare time last summer.

    F14 Optics began as a CAD project during my sophomore year, but developed into a personal exploration when I decided to pursue a form language that was initially out of my skill set. The purpose of this project was to design, excecute, and render a complex 3D model.

        <h3>Research | Form</h3>
        <p>
          I started by getting an idea for goggles’ current surface treatment.
          As I conceptualized the type of forms I wanted to tackle,
          I turned to the organic transitions of bone structures for inspiration.

      <h1>Functional</h1>
      <p>
        It was important that the CAD file was more than just an appearance model.
        With this in mind, I referenced the goggles I owned,
        along with images and models I found online.

    <h3>Developing Aesthetic</h3>
    <p>
      I couldn’t articulate the surface transitions I needed sketching in 3D.
      By working through the front profile,
      I developed my intended aesthetic.

    <h3>So far, so good</h3>

      I was able to build an accurate frame and lens to serve as my guide to design around.

    <h3>Time to restart</h3>
    <p>
      I spent weeks modeling in circles trying to define my surfaces in SolidWorks.
      As my file grew I realized my surfaces were not lining up,
      and I was not getting the aesthetic I desired.
